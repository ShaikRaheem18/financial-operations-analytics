## Key Insights

### 1. Revenue Concentration Among Few Customers
A small subset of customers contributes a disproportionately large share of total revenue.  
The top 10 customers alone generate a significant percentage of overall transaction value, indicating high revenue concentration and dependency on a limited customer base.

---

### 2. High-Risk Customers Drive Major Revenue
A large portion of revenue originates from customers classified under higher risk profiles.  
While these customers are valuable from a revenue perspective, they also pose increased fraud and operational risk, requiring closer monitoring.

---

### 3. Transaction Activity Peaks During Evening Hours
Transaction volume shows a clear peak during evening hours (approximately 8 PM to 10 PM).  
This suggests strong user activity during non-working hours and highlights critical time windows for system performance and monitoring.

---

### 4. Fraud and Failed Transactions Are Not Evenly Distributed
Fraudulent and failed transactions are concentrated within specific customer segments rather than being uniformly distributed.  
This enables targeted risk controls instead of broad, inefficient monitoring strategies.

---

### 5. Average Spend per Customer Indicates Strong Revenue Density
The average transaction spend per customer is relatively high, suggesting quality over quantity in customer transactions.  
This insight supports strategies focused on retaining high-value customers rather than purely increasing transaction volume.

---

### 6. Category-Level Revenue Shows Clear Spending Patterns
Certain transaction categories dominate total revenue, revealing customer spending preferences.  
This information can be leveraged for targeted product offerings and category-specific risk analysis.
